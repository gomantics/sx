Create a Pull Request

- Make sure local changes are committed and pushed, if not ask user to do it
- Compare the current branch to origin/main
- Read through the changes and commits
- Raise a pull request using the gh cli, you might have to `unset GITHUB_TOKEN` if auth issues occur.
- Don't ever fork, we work directly on the originally repo with branches
- Use a succint title
- Keep the description to the point and do not hallucinate
- Use a temporary file for PR description and remove it later with rm linux command.
